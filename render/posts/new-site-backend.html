<main>So, my site has been around for quite a while; according to the <a href="https://github.com/ERROR-404-NULL-NOT-FOUND/error.sh/commit/f3b9722bf603a2f86eaddbd356757e499d1bb67c">GitHub repo</a>, it's been around since January of 2022. Now, when I first created the site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231014215614/https://segfault.us.to/">it had a much different form</a>. It was originally designed to copy the early Revolt website trend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211027232027/https://infi.sh/">started by Jennifer</a> and then <a href="https://zomatree.live/">followed shortly by Zomatree</a>. This early website was poorly designed, bland as hell, and generally didn't reflect me very well, which is why I redesigned it <a href="https://github.com/ERROR-404-NULL-NOT-FOUND/error.sh/commit/f61029a36fc78d9a710102fc91078d32893c96ce">around this time last year</a>, changing it to the terminal style you see right now. This style was designed to resemble UNIX manpages, with my own little touches thrown in to add some life (monochrome is <i>so</i> last century). Last week, I decided that I was tired of manually updating all of tha pages whenever I changed something in the template (and manually updating the post list), so I decided to make a shitty BASH-based SSG for it.
<h3>The SSG in question</h3>
Now, don't get your hopes up. This SSG isn't anything special. In fact, it's pretty much the bare minimum required to actually qualify as an SSG in the first place. It's based on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~error404nullnotfound/CUT/tree/master/item/www/docs/convert.sh">the doc converter I made for CUT</a>, with minor modifications. In fact, the modifications are so minor that I can't even be assed to actually finish this post. Goodbye!</main>
