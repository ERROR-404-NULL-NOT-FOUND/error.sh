You wanna know about me? Here you go
I'm a mildly insane mothgirl that has a heavy interest in low-level systems
programming.
Some of my interests/hobbies include:
- Programming
- Furrying
- Biking
- Dicking around with tech
- Hacking (both in the traditional and the common sense of the word)
- Drawing
- Talking to people on Revolt[1] (@error404nullnotfound#4042)
- System administration, including running my server (which is what this
website runs on!)
- Some more programming

I know C (not very well), Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Scratch (mostly
when I'm bored)

I use OpenBSD[2], Void Linux[3], and 9front[4].
One of my core beliefs is that systems should be simple, understandable, and
hackable; hence the OS choices.
Shoutout to ZealOS[5] for also adhering to these principles, but I do not use
it for obvious reasons.
