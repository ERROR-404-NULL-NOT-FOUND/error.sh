      <h3>A review of Lenovo's Thinkpad T420 from 2011</h3>
    </header>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The T420 is a buisness laptop that released in 2011.
        <br />Being a buisness laptop, it has all of the niceties you would
        expect; it's well-built with an acceptable screen and outstanding
        keyboard, as well as being extremely repairible and upgradable.
        <br />The price is amazing; depending on where you live, you can get one
        for as little as $50 with shipping (this is what I paid for mine).
        <br />
        The I/O is amazing, with 4 USB ports (USB 2.0 though...), VGA and
        DisplayPort out, SD combo and ExpressCard slots, an RJ45 jack, an IEEE
        1394 port (more commonly known as FireWire), and a DVD drive.
        <br />My unit has a "high-res" 1600x900 screen, 12gb of ram (which I
        upgraded from the original 4), a 500GB Intel SSD, and an Intel Core
        i5-2520m processor, as well as a fingerprint reader that I installed.
        <br />The performance is ok; I don't have a model with a dedicated GPU,
        so video playback is a little taxing on the CPU, but other than that it
        works fine for most web browsing. <br />
        Compilation, however, is a bit slow, as should be expected from a CPU of
        this age.

      <h3>My experiences</h3>
      <p>
        I've had this laptop for a little over a year at this point, and it's
        held up quite well. <br />3 days after I got it, it fell from desk
        height onto a concrete floor, from which it sustained minor cosmethetic
        damage but nothing to impede functionality. <br />I've also gone through
        the effort of installing Coreboot on it, which was a major improvement
        over the stock BIOS, if only just because it means that I don't have to
        wait on the Thinkpad start screen. <br />The first time that I opened
        it, I was amazed at how solid it was and how good the keyboard felt.
        <br />Overall, my experience with the machine has been overwhelmingling
        positive, with a few downsides:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The battery life has been rather poor for me, although that may just
          be my third-party battery that seems to be surprisingly bad
        </li>
        <li>
          The basketball surface of the touchpad sucks, so I scraped it off with
          my fingernail
        </li>
        <li>
          On my unit, the DVD drive keeps falling out, but I'm going to blame
          that on the previous owner
        </li>
      </ul>
