<main><h2>What is Linux?</h2>
<p>
First thing that we need to do is establish what Linux, or more specifically
GNU/Linux, actually <i>is</i>. <br />Well the answer is that Linux is a
kernel. <br />Nothing more. <br />GNU/Linux, however, is a common combination
of GNU (the core utilities) and Linux, to form an entire OS. <br />It should
also be noted that GNU/Linux is a UNIX clone, with GNU literally standing for
"GNU is not UNIX". <br />Think windows, but with more freedom (a lot more).
</p>

<!--Reasons to use linux-->
<h2>Why should I use Linux?</h2>
<p>
Next question to address is "Why should I use Linux?".
<br />The answer is really a combination of why many different people use
Linux, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>Freedom</h3>
Linux has freedom not only in the cost sense, but also in the usage.
<br />You are allowed to do quite literally anything to Linux, including
redistribute different versions, as long as the different version carries
the GPL 3.0 licence
</li>

<li>
<h3>Variable complexity</h3>
I know that this might not make sense to those of you who have seen Linux
users constantly switch between terminals, but hear me out.
<br />With Linux, you can choose how complicated you want your experience to
be. <br />Not tech savvy? Some simple (to use) distro like Ubuntu or many of
its derivatives. <br />Want to constantly tinker with your OS? Go for
something more advanced, like Arch, Gentoo, or, if you're really crazy,
Linux From Scratch.
</li>

<li>
<h3>The Terminal</h3>
Now, with many Linux distributions the terminal is not required, but for
power users, it's a godsend.
<br />In Linux, you can do almost anything using the terminal. <br />Want to
change your device name (or hostname)? Sure, you can just go into the
settings and change it that way, but for a power user, simply typing
<code>sudo hostname</code> to use the hostname to command is so much faster.
</li>
</ul>

<!--Concerns-->
<h2>Concerns</h2>
<p>
In this section, I will address some common concerns about switching to Linux
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
The biggest concern for many is gaming.
<br />Now this is understandable, since just a few years ago it was really
difficult to get most games to work. <br />But since the release of proton,
Steam's platform compatibility tool, it has been improving. <br />Not only
that, but also a version of Easy Anti Cheat been has released for Linux,
making many online games work on Linux. <br />However, many games that don't
use EAC will ban you on the basis of cheating if you try to use them with
proton <br />But generally, gaming on Linux is quite a bit better than most
people think.
</li>

<li>
<h3>Office</h3>
Alright, I'm going to be upfront about this, MS Office doesn't work on Linux
as a desktop app (works as a website though).
<br />However, there are a bunch of good Linux alternatives:
<br />LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and Onlyoffice <br />You can try each of
these out on Windows first to see if you like them, and then if you do, you
can dual-boot(consult google, basically Windows ${CONTENT} Linux on the
same drive)
to try out Linux.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ending thoughts</h2>
<p>
Please try out Linux, even if it's just by making a LiveISO (Linux without
permanent storage) and trying it out that way.
