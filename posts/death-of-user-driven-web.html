    <div class="out-error">This article was not edited; I just typed out my thoughts and posted it without getting someone else to read it
        <br>It most likely contains several factual errors, but it is entirely my original thoughts</div>
    <main>
      You heard the title, you read the description, you know generally what I'm going to say here.
      <br><br>This happened a long time ago; before I was on the internet, I hear grand stories of people creating their own websites, interacting together on IRC and forums, and generally just having fun.
      <br><br>Now, the charm and freedom are gone from all but the remote corners of the internet.
      <br><br>They've been replaced by the mechanical, monstrously addicting algorithms of most social media, designed to keep you on the platform as you waste more of your life watching ads; having the shallow conversations that lead nowhere and help no-one except the platform.
      <br><br>Where did the vibrant freedom of the old internet go?
      <br><br>Well, when capitalism discovered the internet, it wouldn't die; it couldn't die.
      <br><br>It was instead forced into the far reaches of the internet, away from the general public; invisible to most, but still there, if you knew where to look for it.
      <br><br>This over-generalized, of course.
      <br><br>Social media is one of the major factors that caused the internet to take off in the first place; the ability to talk to your friends without calling or texting them was revolutionary at the time and changed the way we communicate.
      <br><br>But, as you have no doubt noticed, everything consolidates in social media, and this leads to the death of expression.
      <br><br>Everyone gravitates to the social media platform most used by their communities, or, more often, several platforms.
      <br><br>This leads to everyone having the same, bland, text-only profile.
      <br><br>Even personal websites have fallen victim to this; what used to be independent websites migrated to Geocities, which then migrated to the corporate sterilized likes of Wix and Squarespace.
      <br><br>The only people who still care are the ones who exist mostly isolated from the rest; the people who still use IRC and forums, and, more recently, most of fedi.
      <br><br>This creativity still exists, but most don't find it.
      <br><br>I doubt that anyone that doesn't fall into those categories will ever discover this page, but if you're reading this and that's you: branch out, explore, discover.
      <br><br>The internet is more magnificent than most give it credit for, because most haven't seen the true beauty of it.
