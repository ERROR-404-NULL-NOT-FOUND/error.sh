      <h2><a name="why">Why</a></h2>
      <p>
        There are many reasons why one may want to install Linux on a
        Chromebook, here are some of the most common:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google can't figure out how to optimize ChromeOS</li>
        <li>ChromeOS is incredibly limiting</li>
        <li>Google tracking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I did it for all of the above reasons</p>
      <h2><a name="firmware">Step 1: install Mr. Chromebox firmware</a></h2>
      <p>
        The method used in this guide will be flashing Mr. Chromebox firmware.
        <br />This method has some downsides, such as certain device functions
        not working correctly on some hardware, but I'm going with it because
        the actual OS installation is much more convenient than
        <a href="https://github.com/eupnea-project">Depthboot</a>. <br /><strong
          >This guide assumes that you have already enabled Developer mode and
          have some familarity with UNIX/Linux commands</strong
        >
      </p>
      <h3><a name="check-reqs">Checking flashing requirements</a></h3>
      <p>
        The first step to flashing cfw is to determine whether or not your
        device is supported and what you have to do to disable it.
        <br />Consult
        <a href="https://wiki.mrchromebox.tech/Supported_Devices"
          >Mr. Chromebox's chart</a
        >
        to determine whether your device is supported. If your device is
        supported, note the write protect method for use in the next section
      </p>
      <h3><a name="write-protect">Disabling hardware write-protect</a></h3>
      <p>
        If your device is supported, go to section for its write protect method
        below
      </p>
      <h4><a name="screw">Screw</a></h4>
      <p>Steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Disassemble the machine</li>
        <li>
          Find the write-protect screw following the diagram below (credit:
          memcpy.io) and remove it
        </li>
        <li>Re-assemble the machine</li>
      </ol>
      <img
        src="static/images/2017-02-27_wp_screw.jpg"
        alt="an image of a disassembled Chromebook with an arrow pointing to the write-protect screw on the left side of the battery"
      />
      <h4><a name="battery">CR50 (battery)</a></h4>
      <p>
        This method requires access to a power supply in order to run the device
        without a battery. Steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Disassemble the machine</li>
        <li>Find the battery connector and disconnect it</li>
        <li>Flash the custom firmware</li>
        <li>Re-assemble the machine</li>
      </ol>
      <h4><a name="jumper">CR50 (jumper)</a></h4>
      <p>
        This method requires more research and skill, as you need to figure out
        which jumper to bridge and how to bridge it, with the easiest method
        being a short wire soldered to the board. Steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Disassemble the machine</li>
        <li>Find and jump the required contacts</li>
        <li>Re-assemble the machine</li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="flashing">Flashing the firmware</a></h3>
      <p>
        Now that the hardware write-protect has been disabled, we can move on to
        flashing the firmware itself. This process is fairly painless and just
        requires a stable power supply and a bit of time. Run the following
        commands in VT2 by pressing ctrl+alt+right arrow (ctrl+alt+left arrow to
        get back) with login <code>chronos</code>:
      </p>
      <br />Change directory into Downloads

      <div class="codeblock">cd ~/Downloads</div>
      Download the script
      <div class="codeblock">
        curl -LO https://mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh
      </div>
      Run the script as root
      <div class="codeblock">sudo bash firmware-util.sh</div>
      Select option 2 (it should be "Install/Update UEFI (Full ROM) Firmware")
      <br />You should see
      <div class="out-info">Install/Update UEFI Full ROM Firmware</div>
      along with the following info message:
      <div class="out-warn">
        IMPORTANT: flashing the firmware has the potential to brick your device,
        <br />requiring relatively inexpensive hardware and some technical
        knowledge to <br />recover.Not all boards can be tested prior to
        release, and even then slight <br />differences in hardware can lead to
        unforeseen failures. <br />If you don't have the ability to recover from
        a bad flash, you're taking a risk.
        <br />
        <br />You have been warned.
      </div>
      At the prompt, press y to continue.
      <br />If you see the error
      <div class="out-error">
        Hardware write-protect enabled, cannot flash Full ROM firmware.
      </div>
      then you failed to disable write protect, refer <a href="#step2">here</a>.
      <br />It will then warn you that you should install a UEFI-compatible OS:
      <div class="out-warn">
        NOTE: After flashing UEFI firmware, you will need to install a
        UEFI-compatible <br />
        OS; ChromeOS will no longer be bootable. See
        https://mrchromebox.tech/#faq
      </div>
      press y to continue.
      <br />If you see the following warning, I advise that you do not continue
      <div class="out-warn">
        NOTE: Booting from eMMC on AMD Picasso-based devices does not currently
        work -- <br />only NVMe, SD and USB. If you have a device with eMMC
        storage you will not be <br />able to boot from it after installing the
        UEFI Full ROM firmware."
      </div>
      Next, it will ask you to make a backup of your firmware. I would
      personally do this just to upload it to the Internet Archive, but you
      don't have to.
      <div class="out-warn">Create a backup copy of your stock firmware?</div>
      <div style="display: block; padding: 1%">
        <br />This is highly recommended in case you wish to return your device
        to stock <br />configuration/run ChromeOS, or in the (unlikely) event
        that things go south <br />and you need to recover using an external
        EEPROM programmer.
      </div>
      It will then download the firmware file:
      <div class="out-warn">Downloading Full ROM firmware</div>
      After this is finished downloading, it may display a couple irrelevant
      info messages.
      <br />It will then disable the software write protect. <br /><strong
        >This shouldn't fail</strong
      >
      <div class="out-warn">
        Disabling software write-protect and clearing the WP range
      </div>
      After that it should start installing the firmware.
      <br /><strong
        >If the power disconnects while this is happening, your device will be
        bricked and you will have to use an external programmer to
        recover</strong
      >
      <div class="out-warn">
        Installing Full ROM firmware (may take up to 90s)
      </div>
      After that's finished, congratulations, you have a Corebooted Chromebook!
      <br /><strong
        >Don't reboot until you flash a USB drive with the installation medium
        of your choosing.</strong
      >

      <p>In case you forgot the basic flashing procedure, here it is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the ISO</li>
        <li>Verify the checksum (usually using sha256sum)</li>
        <li>
