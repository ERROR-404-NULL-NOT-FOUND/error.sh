  <h2>This page documents my random shenanigans that don't fit into a proper post</h2>
  <div class=shenanigan>
    <div class=failed>FAIL</div>
    Downgrading my iPhone 5S
    <br>Turns out that checkm8 reliability on Linux with A7s is really fucking bad.
  </div>

  <div class=shenanigan>
    <div class=failed>FAIL</div> Downgrading my iPhone 4S
    <br>Figured out that checkm8ing an A5 requires an Arduino and a USB shield, which I don't have
    <br>Not before wasting a night on it, tho :/
  </div>

  <div class=shenanigan>
    <div class=succeed>OK</div> Setting up my audio system
    <br>Not really a shenanigan, as it was something actually practical, but it was fun and now my music sounds good
    <br>(Speakers: Polkaudio R1s, amp: Sony STR-Dh130)
  </div>

  <div class=shenanigan>
    <div class=pending>...</div> Adding LUKS2 to shimboot
    Added it, overwrote my root with the image, added it again, couldn't test
    <br>Currently awaiting testing
  </div>
