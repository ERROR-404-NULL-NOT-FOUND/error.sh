  <h3>TOOL</h3>
  Genre: Rock
  <br>Complexity: wtf
  <br>Personal rating: 10/10
  <br>Albums that I like:
  <ul>
    <li>Lateralus</li>
    <li>10,000 days</li>
    <li>Fear Inoculum</li>
    <li>Ã†nima</li>
  </ul>
  <br>TOOL is undoubtedly my favourite band of all time, and I can't really describe why.
  <br>I could obviously point to the complexity of the music or the specific genre, but other bands have met that
  criteria without having nearly the impact of TOOL's releases.
  <br>Anyway, I don't really care for their earlier albums such as Undertow or their demo tapes, but the later albums
  such as
  Lateralus and Fear Inoculum are some of the few pieces of music that maintain perminent residence inside my head
  with my consent.

  <h3>A Perfect Circle</h3>
  Genre: Rock
  <br>Complexity: Moderate
  <br>Personal rating: 7/10
  <br>Albums that I like:
  <ul>
    <li>Mer de noms</li>
    <li>Thirteenth Step</li>
  </ul>
  I very much like their music, but it doesn't have the punch or maturity of TOOL.
  </br>The mixing also leaves a lot to be desired, with my mom commenting "it sounds like the guitar's under water."

  <h3>System of a Down</h3>
  Genre: Heavy Metal
  <br>Complexity: Moderate
  <br>Personal rating: 7/10
  <br>Albums that I like:
  <ul>
    <li>Toxicity</li>
    <li>Steal this Album!</li>
  </ul>
  Fun music that I usually get lost in, with a really fucking good message.
  <br>The albums also usually have a hilarious mixture of serious songs and singing about a horse on a jet pilot.
  <br>A lot of the songs also leave you with whiplash, as they go back and forth between slow and melodic and fast and
  grating.

  <h3>Knife Party</h3>
  Genre: Dubstep
  <br>Complexity: Moderate-low
  <br>Personal rating: 6/10
  <br>Albums that I like
  <ul>
    <li>Rage Valley</li>
    <li>100% No Modern Talking</li>
    <li>Haunted House</li>
    <li>Abandon Ship</li>
  </ul>
  Wow, this band's sound changes a lot between albums.
  <br>Like, listen to Rage Valley and Abandon Ship back-to-back and you'll see what I mean.
  <br>Anyway, dubstep is fun, but usually incredibly repetative, and Knife Party is no exception.
  <br>The mixing is amazing, tho.
