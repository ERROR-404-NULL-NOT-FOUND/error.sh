  You wanna know about me? Here you go
  <br /><br />My name is Rosa Green, <br /><br />I'm in 10th grade at the age of
  16 <br /><br />My pronouns are she/her. <br /><br />Some of my
  interests/hobbies include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Furrying</li>
  <li>Biking</li>
  <li>Dicking around with tech</li>
  <li>Hacking (both in the traditional and the common sense of the word)</li>
  <li>Drawing</li>
  <li>
    Talking to people on
    <a href="https://revolt.chat">Revolt</a> (@error404nullnotfound#4042)
  </li>
  <li>
    System administration, including running my server (which is what this
    website runs on!)
  </li>
  <li>Some more programming</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br />I know C (not very well), Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Scratch
  (mostly when I'm bored) <br /><br />I use <a href="https://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> and 
  <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a>.
  <br>One of my core beliefs is that systems should be simple, understandable, and hackable; hence the OS choices.
  <br>Shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/Zeal-Operating-System/ZealOS">ZealOS</a> for also adhering to these principles, but I do not use it for obvious reasons.
