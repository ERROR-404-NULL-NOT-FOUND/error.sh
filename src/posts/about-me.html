You wanna know about me? Here you go
I'm a mildly insane mothgirl that has a heavy interest in low-level systems programming. 
Some of my interests/hobbies include:
  - Programming
  - Furrying
  - Biking
  - Dicking around with tech
  - Hacking (both in the traditional and the common sense of the word)
  - Drawing
  - Talking to people on Revolt[1] (@error404nullnotfound#4042)
  - System administration, including running my server (which is what this website runs on!)
  - Some more programming

I know C (not very well), Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Scratch (mostly when I'm bored)

I use OpenBSD[2], Void Linux[3], and 9front[4].
One of my core beliefs is that systems should be simple, understandable, and hackable; hence the OS choices.
Shoutout to ZealOS[5] for also adhering to these principles, but I do not use it for obvious reasons.
