        <!--What is Linux-->
        <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
        <p>
            First thing that we need to do is establish what Linux, or more specifically GNU/Linux, actually <i>is</i>.
            <br>Well the answer is: GNU/Linux is a Free And Open Source(FOSS) operating system, made by Linus Torvalds, based on another operating system, made in the 1960's: UNIX
            <br>Think windows, but with more freedom(a lot more).
        </p>
        
        <!--Reasons to use linux-->
        <h2>Why should I use Linux?</h2>
        <p>
            Next question to address is "Why should I use Linux?".
            <br>The answer is really a combination of why many different people use Linux, including:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Freedom</h3>
                    Linux has freedom not only in the cost sense, but also in the usage.
                    <br>You are allowed to do quite literally anything to Linux, including redistribute different versions, as long as the different version carries the GPL 3.0 licence
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Variable complexity</h3>
                    <br>I know that this might not make sense to those of you who have seen Linux users constantly switch between terminals, but hear me out.
                    <br>With Linux, you can choose how complicated you want your experience to be.
                    <br>Not tech savvy? Some simple (to use) distro like Ubuntu or many of its derivatives.
                    <br>Want to constantly tinker with your OS? Go for something more advanced, like Arch, Gentoo, or, if you're really crazy, Linux From Scratch.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>The Terminal</h3>
                    Now, with many Linux distributions the terminal is not required, but for power users, it's a godsend.
                    <br>In Linux, you can do almost anything using the terminal.
                    <br>Want to change your device name (or hostname)? Sure, you can just go into the settings and change it that way, but for a power user, simply typing <code>sudo hostname</code> to use the hostname to command is so much faster.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <!--Concerns-->
        <h2>Concerns</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, I will address some common concerns about switching to Linux
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Gaming</h3>
                    The biggest concern for many is gaming.
                    <br>Now this is understandable, since just a few years ago it was really difficult to get most games to work.
                    <br>But since the release of proton, Steam's platform compatibility tool, it has been improving.
                    <br>Not only that, but also a version of Easy Anti Cheat been has released for Linux, making many online games work on Linux.
                    <br>However, many games that don't use EAC will ban you on the basis of cheating if you try to use them with proton
                    <br>But generally, gaming on Linux is quite a bit better than most people think.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Office</h3>
                    Alright, I'm going to be upfront about this, MS Office doesn't work on Linux as a desktop app (works as a website though).
                    <br>However, there are a bunch of good Linux alternatives:
                    <br>LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and Onlyoffice
                    <br>You can try each of these out on Windows first to see if you like them, and then if you do, you can dual-boot(consult google, basically Windows & Linux on the same drive) to try out Linux.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Ending thoughts</h2>
        <p>Please try out Linux, even if it's just by making a LiveISO (Linux without permanent storage) and trying it out that way.</p>
